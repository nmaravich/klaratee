SoftDelete
==========

This is a small plugin for a DRY implementation of soft delete.


Example
=======

Just add the plugin to vendor/plugins : git clone git@github.com:sumanmukherjee03/soft_delete.git

For any model in which you want to implement a soft delete, add a "deleted" column with data type "boolean" through migration and then include a module called "SoftDelete" in your model like this : include SoftDelete. 

And thats it!

If for any of your models you create a "deleted" column having type "boolean", then on calling destroy on the object of that model, it will implement a soft delete.
If you have not created a "deleted" column for a model, then it will fall back to a hard delete.
